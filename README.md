# AtomicMassCalculator

This is a GUI program that allows for the easy calculation of the atomic mass of any molecule. When opened, it presents the user with a periodic table with all of the elements (Keep in mind that the elements are listed by their symbols, and not their full names). Each button is mapped to the atomic mass of that element. To calculate the atomic mass, one can simply click each button to add that element to the total mass. For molecules with multiple atoms of a certain element the user would simply click the element multiple times. For example, to calculate the atomic mass of carbon dioxide, one would click carbon once and oxygen twice. The CE button at the top clears the calculation.

Moving forwards the plan is to possibly turn this into a stoichiometry calculator.
